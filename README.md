# PHPVMSBUILDER
Building Csv Files to create your Virtual Airline from FS-Traffic Schedules.

when you first start out creating a Virtual Airline you will have an idea of what area of the world
you want to operate in and from what airports in that area and what airlines you want to create and so-on.

You can set up PHPVMS manually and input everything by hand which will take time and maybe you will lose interest in 
setting up your virtual airline,

So why not use some software to create the 'CSV' files that you can inport into PHHPVMS directly from a few control files
or 'CSV' files that you create yourself and run through the software to create these PHPVMS 'CSV' Files.

Basically for this project you will need four things 
[1] Access to a server that uses PHP and Mysql. Mamp is a good framework to use.
[2] Obviously a PHPVMS V7 airline for which you will upload the generated 'CSV' files after you have built and perhaps edited them
[3] The information you need to run this process i.e. airline codes and airport codes etc.
[4] A copy of the FS-TRAFFIC schedule files.  These will not be given out in this project.

With all this in mind you will need to edit some of the configuration files and project 'CSV' files to suit your airline and
server environment but these will be explained with documents in each folder.
